Add proper errors in the output - I think this might be a front end problem
Add support for arrow key input, console prompts, basic sound output, and a canvas for raster graphics with a graphics library.
fix syntax highlighting
write a test case to ensure input remains halting
write a test case to make sure numbers are treated as numbers when accepted as input

fix this:

console-log as 'What is your name?'
call console-log
set in as input
call console-clear
console-log as 'Hello, ' plus in plus '!'
call console-log
set timeout as 2
call timeout
call console-clear

Timeout is preventing console-clear from running at the end
