# PseudoWoodo
An experimental interpreted language implemented in JavaScript primarily by DeepSeek, with syntax and UX design by EuphoricPenguin.

[Try out the Web Interpreter](https://euphoricpenguin.github.io/PseudoWoodo/)

If you have NodeJS installed, you can also use the headless mode:
`node headless.js --file hello-world.pw`

PseudoWoodo examines the capabilities of LLMs at this stage. If you want to contribute to the project somehow, by all means. I'm going to continue using DeepSeek to squash out as many bugs as I can.
