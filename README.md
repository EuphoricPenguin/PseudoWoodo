# PseudoWoodo
An experimental interpreted language implemented in JavaScript primarily by DeepSeek, with syntax and UX design by EuphoricPenguin. Mistral Small 3 has also recently joined the team to help with front-end development.

If you have NodeJS installed, you can also use the headless mode:
`node headless.js --file hello-world.pw`

PseudoWoodo explores what LLMs are capable of at this juncture. DeepSeek seems to be making waves in interesting ways I have not seen before, especially for an open-source model. If you want to contribute to the project somehow, by all means. I'm going to continue using DeepSeek to squash out as many bugs as I can, and the end-goal is to add some graphics and sound capabilities inspired by the PICO-8.
